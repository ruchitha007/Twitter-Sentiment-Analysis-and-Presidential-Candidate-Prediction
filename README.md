This project explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques for Twitter sentiment analysis to predict the 2020 U.S. Presidential election results. The study combines data cleaning, sentiment scoring, and predictive modeling to analyze public sentiment towards candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Using tools like VADER for sentiment analysis and models like XGBoost for prediction, the project effectively demonstrates how digital discourse mirrors election dynamics. Despite challenges such as noisy data, linguistic diversity, and social media biases, the research highlights key findings on sentiment trends and model performance, offering valuable insights into the interplay between social media sentiment and political outcomes. The innovative approach and robust methodology make this work a notable contribution to the field of intelligent systems and political analytics.
